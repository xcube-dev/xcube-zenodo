## Code style <a name="code-style"></a>

The `xcube-zenodo` code compliant to [PEP-8](https://pep8.org/) except for a line
length of 88 characters as recommended
by [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/).
Since black is un-opinionated regarding the order of imports,
we use the following three import blocks separated by an empty
line:

1. Python standard library imports, e.g., `os`, `typing`, etc
2. 3rd-party imports, e.g., `xarray`, `zarr`, etc
3. Relative `xcube_zenodo` module imports using `.` prefix.
