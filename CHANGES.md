## Changes in 0.1.1 (in development)

### Enhancements


### Fixes

* xcube-zenodo is now compatible with Python 3.10 and 3.11. Compatibility was
  previously limited to Python â‰¥3.12 due to the usage of identical quotes in nested
  f-strings. This has been fixed by using different quotes.

## Changes in 0.1.0

* Initial version of Zenodo Data Store.
